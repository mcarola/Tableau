## 🎨 Visualization Philosophy

My approach to data visualization in Tableau focuses on:

1. **Clarity First**: Every chart should answer a specific question
2. **Interactivity**: Users should explore data at their own pace
3. **Context Matters**: Visualizations should tell a complete story
4. **Performance**: Fast, responsive dashboards even with large datasets
5. **Aesthetics**: Professional design that enhances comprehension
